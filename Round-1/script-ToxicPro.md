To tackle this, we have introduced a feature called AI report where teens can report the account, after that, the LLM uses NLP to determine the credibility of the report and block the threatning user from using their account at all. 
The user gets an error saying "there was a problem connecting to our server"

"everyone blocks unknown messages, but we take it a step further by having the AI report feature.
