[Scene fades in with soft, minimalist visuals: A teen scrolling on their phone, a warm glow from the screen.]

Shyam (Calm, inviting voice):
"Social media is where we connect. Where we share. Where we create. It’s incredible—until it’s not. A hurtful comment, an unsafe ad, or something you shouldn’t see. It happens fast."

[Text on-screen: Introducing TeenGarde.]

Shyam (Confident, uplifting):
"TeenGarde is here to change that. A smarter, safer way to experience social media—powered by cutting-edge AI. Protecting, empowering, and inspiring you every step of the way."

[Scene transitions to a teen pausing before posting a comment. A prompt appears: Think twice. Be kind. The teen smiles and rewrites the post.]

Hard (Encouraging):
"TeenGarde starts with you. It prompts you to think twice before you post—encouraging positivity and creating a more thoughtful digital world."

[Text on-screen: Age-appropriate content. Thoughtful interactions. Safer connections.]

[Scene shifts to animations: harmful accounts and ads are seamlessly filtered out of a vibrant digital space.]

Jayrup (Playful):
"Ads are everywhere. But not every ad is a good one."

[Text on-screen: Ethical ads. Better experiences.]

Jayrup (Professional):
"TeenGarde analyzes and filters ads so only safe, ethical, and age-appropriate ones make it to your feed. Unsafe ones? Blocked. Ethical advertisers? Encouraged to do even better."

Potential Limitations and Their Solutions
[Scene shifts to Shyam speaking directly to the audience. Calm but thoughtful tone.]

Shyam (Transparent):
"Like any AI, TeenGarde isn’t perfect. Challenges are part of the process."

[Scene: A visual of the AI system improving over time, based on user feedback.]

Hard (Candid):
"Sometimes, harmless content might be flagged, or harmful content might slip through. We know how important it is to get this right."

[Scene: Teens connecting joyfully in a safe online space while guardians glance at anonymized insights.]

Shyam (Hopeful):
"We’re here to grow with you. Together, we can create a safer, smarter digital world."

[Scene shifts to a montage of positive social media experiences.]

Hard (Reassuring):
"At TeenGarde, privacy is just as important as safety. Guardians see only what they need—anonymized insights that keep trust intact."

[Text on-screen: Privacy-first. Ethical AI.]

Hard (Empowering):
"Open communication, not invasive monitoring. That’s how we build trust."

[Scene: A bright, cheerful montage of teens expressing creativity and connection.]

Jayrup (Inspiring):
"Social media should be a space for growth, connection, and creativity."

Jayrup (Optimistic):
"With TeenGarde, teens can explore freely, and families can rest easy knowing they’re safe."

[Scene: Bold text on a white background: TeenGarde: Safer, Smarter, Social.]

Shyam (Confident):
"Let’s build a digital world that’s not just connected, but empowered—for everyone."

This streamlined version reflects Apple’s aspirational and user-first tone, focusing on clarity and trust while leaving room for placeholders where Fatema and Yogi would appear.
