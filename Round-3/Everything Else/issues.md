# The Challenge

Create a fast, structured, and meaningful feedback loop between policymakers at 10 Downing Street and the public. The solution should improve government awareness of public perception at different stages of policymaking:

    1. Idea Generation – Understanding how the public perceives potential new policies.
    2. Policy Design – Refining policies and designing their implementation.
    3. Implementation – Monitoring real-world impact and making adjustments.

## Summary of the Issue
Currently, traditional feedback methods (e.g., public consultations) are too slow to keep up with the fast-paced policymaking process at No.10. As a result, the government struggles to stay connected with public opinion, both when formulating policies and during their implementation. A 2023 Office for National Statistics report highlights that 63% of people feel they have little or no say in government decisions.

Your task is to propose a better, quicker, and more structured way to collect and act on public feedback.


## List of Issues

1. Slow Feedback Mechanisms
    a. Traditional methods (e.g., public consultations) take too long to gather and process feedback.
    b. Policymaking at No.10 moves quickly, making it hard to incorporate timely public input.
2. Lack of Public Confidence
    a. 63% of people feel they have little or no say in government decisions (ONS 2023).
    b. A disconnect exists between policymakers and public sentiment.
3. Complex Government Structure
    a. Policies are implemented through multiple layers (departments, agencies, councils, services).
    b. This complexity makes it harder to track how policies are received and adjusted.
4. Limited Oversight & Adaptability
    a. Once a policy is implemented, monitoring its real-world impact is challenging.
    b. Adjustments based on public response are often slow or ineffective.
5. Insufficient Public Engagement in Early Stages
    a. Public input is often minimal during idea generation and policy design phases.
    b. Policies may not reflect real public needs or concerns.
6. One-Way Communication
    a. Feedback is often collected but not acted upon or communicated back to the public.
    b. This reinforces public disengagement and distrust in government responsiveness.

## Key Takeaway
The government needs a faster, more structured, and interactive feedback loop to ensure policies are informed by and responsive to public opinion at all stages of policymaking.
